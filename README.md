# 📱🎤📓 Noted App - Technical Test
</h1>

## Introduction 
A technical test as part of an interview for Digital Workroom.

My task involved building a React web application that allows users to subscribe to the newsletter by simply entering their email addresses. Valid email addresses will be securely stored in the Firestore database. The application was built with React and JSX alongside Jest and React Testing library for testing purposes.

```bash
gh repo clone yan-fung/tech-test-notedapp
```

2. To install the package locally:

## Technology
- [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [React Testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/)

## Improvements & Further Development
If I would have more time, I would like to add the following features to my application:
- Making the application more repsonsive to different sizes of device.
- Allowing users to see some basic info regarding the stars/planets alongside the images.
- Changing the UI design to make it more appealing and user-friendly.
